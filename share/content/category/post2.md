# Post 2
This post has an incoming link from the first post.
It also shares a graph edge with the "test" tag and the "category" category.
Note that identifiers are not specified by type (post, tag, category) so each identifier must be unique.
A tag names "posts" will collide with a category named "posts" and should be avoided.
